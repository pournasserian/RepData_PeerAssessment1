```{r}
raw_data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
raw_data$date <- as.Date(as.character(raw_data$date))
```

#data <- raw_data[!is.na(raw_data$steps), ]
#no need to remove

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data <- aggregate(steps ~ date, raw_data, sum )
hist(data$steps)
```

mean is `r mean(data$steps)`

median is `r median(data$steps)`



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
